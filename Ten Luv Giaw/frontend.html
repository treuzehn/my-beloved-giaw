            We've been talking for only a month, but we've already been through a lotâ€”both joy and sadness. We've laughed and cried together. There were times we didn't understand each other, but we always got through it, just like we always do. I hope you know how much I love you, and I wish I could lay down my life for you. <br><br> <div class="endtext">- Love always, Ten.</div>
